## Purpose
Develop a web scraper designed to extract movie reviews from various websites. This tool will enable efficient data collection for research, analysis, and decision-making, addressing the need for comprehensive insights into film criticism.

## Description
This project will involve building a web scraper that navigates the specified websites, extracts movie review data, and stores it in CSV format. The project will utilize Beautiful Soup, a Python library tailored for parsing HTML and XML documents. 
- Key features:
  - Configurable data extraction based on user-defined parameters
  - Error handling for common web scraping issues (e.g., broken links, access restrictions)

## New Concepts
- Advanced usage of Beautiful Soup for complex data parsing specific to movie reviews.
- Techniques for handling and storing large datasets of reviews.
- Implementing web scraping ethics, including respect for `robots.txt` and rate limiting

## Resources
- **Hardware:** Computer with internet access
- **Software:** Python, Beautiful Soup, libraries for data storage (e.g., Pandas), text editor/IDE
- **Estimated Costs:** Minimal, primarily software tools (most are free or open-source)

## Dependencies
- Installation of Python and necessary libraries (requests, Beautiful Soup, etc.)
- Access to target websites for data extraction:
  - IMDb (Internet Movie Database): IMDb

## Risks
- Potential website restrictions that may prevent scraping
- Changes in website structure could affect the crawling logic
- Legal considerations regarding data scraping from specific sites

- **Sprint 4: Data Storage Implementation** (11/11)  
  Implement data storage options (CSV, JSON, database).
  
- **Sprint 5: Testing and Debugging** (11/25)  
  Conduct thorough testing and fix identified issues.
  
- **Sprint 6: Final Presentation and Documentation** (12/9)  
  Prepare documentation and present the final project to stakeholders.
